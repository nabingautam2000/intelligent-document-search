What interests you most - art and museums, historical sites, food culture, or nightlife? Also, what's your approximate budget range? I love history and architecture. Budget is around $3000 including flights from the US. Perfect! I'd suggest the classic triangle: Rome (ancient history), Paris (medieval to modern), and Prague (medieval charm). 4-5 days each with travel days. Rome has incredible Roman ruins, Paris has Notre Dame and Louvre, Prague has a fairy-tale old town. That sounds amazing! What's the best way to get around between cities? Trains are your best bet! Get a Eurail Pass for flexibility. Rome to Paris is about 11 hours overnight (book a sleeper), Paris to Prague is 12 hours with one connection. Much more scenic and comfortable than flying between cities."
