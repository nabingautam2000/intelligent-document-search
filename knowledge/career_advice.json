    "content": "I'm thinking about changing careers from marketing to software development. Is it too late to start at 32? Absolutely not too late! 32 is actually a great age for a career change - you have work experience, maturity, and life skills that complement technical learning. What draws you to software development? I've always been interested in technology and I like problem-solving. Plus the job market seems strong. Those are excellent reasons! Your marketing background is actually valuable - many developers lack business understanding. Consider starting with web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or Python. Have you tried any coding tutorials yet? I've done some basic HTML/CSS. What's the best path - bootcamp, self-study, or degree? Each has merits! Bootcamps are intensive and job-focused (3-6 months), self-study is flexible and cheap, degrees are comprehensive but take 2-4 years. Given your age and experience, I'd lean toward bootcamp + self-study combo for fastest entry."
