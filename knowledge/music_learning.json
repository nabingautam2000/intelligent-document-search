    "content": "I'm 28 and want to learn guitar. Is it harder to learn instruments as an adult? Not harder, just different! Adults actually have advantages - better focus, understanding of theory, and realistic goal-setting. Your fingers might be less flexible initially, but you'll progress methodically. What style of music interests you? I love classic rock and some folk music. Should I start with acoustic or electric guitar? For classic rock and folk, I'd suggest starting with acoustic! It builds finger strength, doesn't require an amp, and you can play anywhere. Plus, many classic rock songs sound great acoustic. Once you're comfortable, adding electric later is easy. How long before I can play actual songs instead of just exercises? Great news - you can start with simple songs almost immediately! Learn 3 chords (G, C, D or Em, Am, C) and you can play dozens of songs. 'Wonderwall' by Oasis uses just 4 chords. Focus on chord transitions over perfect technique at first."
