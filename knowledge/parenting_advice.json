    "content": "My 3-year-old suddenly refuses to go to bed at night. Bedtime has become a 2-hour battle. Help! This is so common around age 3! They're asserting independence and testing boundaries. When did this start? Any recent changes like new sibling, moving, or starting preschool? Started about 3 weeks ago when we moved to a new house. She keeps getting up and coming to our room. Ah, that explains it! New environment can be scary. Try a consistent bedtime routine in her new room - same songs, books, order. Maybe let her pick out special 'big girl' pajamas or a nightlight for her new room to make it feel safe and hers. Should I keep walking her back to bed when she comes out? Yes, but stay boring! Walk her back calmly with minimal talking or emotion. 'It's bedtime, back to bed.' Don't engage in conversation or get frustrated (easier said than done!). Consistency is key - it may take a week or two."
