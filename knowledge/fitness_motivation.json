What type of exercise did you enjoy before? And how many days per week are you realistically able to commit right now? I used to run and do some weight training. I think I can manage 3 days a week to start. Perfect plan! Start with 20-minute walk/jog intervals twice a week, plus one day of bodyweight exercises (pushups, squats, planks). Listen to your body - some muscle soreness is normal, sharp pain is not. How long before I can get back to my previous fitness level? Generally, you can regain fitness faster than building it initially - maybe 6-12 weeks to feel strong again, depending on how fit you were before. Focus on consistency over intensity. Celebrate small wins along the way!"
