# Intelligent Document Search

This project is an AI-powered document assistant that helps you intelligently interact with your local files. It provides a conversational interface where you can ask natural language questions to:
* Semantically search for information within your JSON knowledge base.
* Find files by name.
* Locate content inside documents.

The system intelligently selects the appropriate search method and provides answers that are directly grounded in the retrieved content, preventing hallucinations. It also manages your chat history for easy reference.
